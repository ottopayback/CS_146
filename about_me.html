        Hi there! My name is Declan Bayliss, and these are some cool facts about me! Starting things off I lived in Singapore for about six and a half years. I moved back to the United States the summer before freshman year of high school. I'm a pretty big gamer and League of legends is where its at. Also Ramen and pizza are my favorite foods.
